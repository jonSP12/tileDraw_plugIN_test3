[EDIT],

Download the project added it to your Godot4 projects, 
open the scene "testedel.tscn",
and press "run current scene" button ( F6 )... 
Running the "main scene" will go to a diferent example.



For now set the nodes "mouseSprite2" and "view" to not visible,
To draw on subViewPort set those nodes to visible, 
and comment the (for loop) in node "testdel" line "182" - "for key in textures:"

This project its in a very early stage. Iam adding it to gitHub now, has a motivation
to keep me doing it and finishen it.


Now that "godot4 tileMap" flips/rotations are done and have been added, this "tileDraw editor" is useless, 
hopefully i will be able to finished it, and give the user and myself enough understanding and experience, 
that coding a tileSet is not something very difficult to do.
